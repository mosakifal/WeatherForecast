For this project i've decided to use in meromy data for username and password. In a real application a database will be used instead
To Test the application you will need the following loging details : 
	Username : mohamed
	Password : mohamed123 
	Role : Admin

        Username : james
	Password : james123
	Role : Sales

mohamed has the admin role so he can get forcast. 
After logging in please click on forcast on the navigation bar to retreive the weather information. 

The other user james doesn't have admin role so het can't retreive the weather information.
